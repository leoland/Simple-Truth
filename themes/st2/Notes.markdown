#Blog
## Allow multiple-authors
  - ACF relationship / Co authors plugin
  - we definitely want to tap into the users table so we can link & pull their picture painlessly, the tricky thing will be adding co-authored posts under a an author's list of posts. the co-authors plugin seems to do this according to their FAQ, but requires conditional theme integration.
 ## Re-styling of archive, category & single page template (Design will change 30% - 40%)
  - Widgetized sidebar across entire blog
    -- register and style a new widget area as well as provide base styles for future widgets.
  - Newsletter signup integration
    - Mail chimp (or other existing newsletter service) or are we coding one up?
    - depending on how we want the form to look/act optin monster or a similar plugin might be of great help here.
  - Style social media icons (or implement custom solution)
    - Current plugin seems to have clean predictable code.

non oxford commma, blog header in sidebar will link to blog homepage. 90 alpha for title


might also like, tablet remove images, mobile -> vertical stack.

lets chat = link to contact page

on sidebar, share

# Clients
- Restyle sliders (https://invis.io/DE7G644P8#/106344609_3-1_Client_Stories)
  - An issue I forsee is that adding or taking away a quote now will change the dimensions of a slide (based on images provided. e.g. assuming constant ratio for slides, taking away a quote will allow the slide to expand horizontally and thus, vertically as well.) This might also influence how they scale at breakpoints.
  - with slides now taking less than 70% of the width of the page, we can redefine how they are served (similar treatment we did to people) and shave off some load time here.
- Styling modifications to "protected" page login
  - for password protected posts or for user login? both doable but one is page one is pageS and requires small changes in a lot of places.

# Jobs
- New custom post type for careers
- View all jobs template
- Single job page template
  - nothing crazy pants here just expanding the site a chunk, new templates, fields & relationships possibly


#Contact
- Custom-designed confirmation when form is submitted
  - Current forms plugin lets us redirect on confirmation or put stuff on a WYSIWYG editor (html allowed, and we have access to the info the user submitted e.g. name & email) so we can play with those options.
- Redesign/redevelop "Work at simple truth" area

#Site wide footer
- Add newsletter signup form / integration
- Replace Pinterest with Instagram
    -simple hardcoding stuff.
    Simple Truth (@yoursimpletruth).
